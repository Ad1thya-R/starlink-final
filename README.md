# Starlink

## Co-creator of Starlink, a space adventure game powered by unity engine.

Part of a team of 4, we developed a 3D exploration game using unity and blender. 
I handled the low-poly design of objects in blender and the animation of the main character.

We ended with a product that has a similar gameplay philosophy to games uch as Astroneer, Rust and Minecraft.
